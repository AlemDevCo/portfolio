        <p class="Paragraph">Hey! I'm AlemDev. I have many different passions that I love. I make music, I do 2D Art and I develop games. I also DJ as a hobby sometimes. Anyway, I'm 15 years old, I'm professional and active, mostly on Discord. I'm able to do Part-Time jobs and commissions but not full time since I have school and life in the middle of that. Hope to work with you in the future, -Alem.</p>
